    <h1>Statement of Faith & Beliefs</h1>
    <p>The ABC’s of Our Statement of Faith We Believe:</p>

    <p>A. That the Bible is the Word of God, given by direct inspiration; and is infallible and inerrant. We believe specifically that the Authorized Version (KJV) is a correct translation of the Received Text (Textus Receptus) which has been divinely preserved from the original autographs given to the prophets and apostles by plenary inspiration of the Holy Spirit. This church does not accept or use any other translation in the English tongue (2 Timothy 3:16-17; 2 Peter 1:20-21).</p>


<p>B. That there is one God, eternally existent in three Persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit (Psalm 2:2,7; Psalm 139:1-16; Isaiah 63:10; John 4:24; 15:26; 16:7; James 1:17).</p>
 
<p>C. That the Lord Jesus Christ is the uniquely begotten Son of God, and fully man; that He was virgin-born, lived a sinless life, was crucified, died and was buried; that He was resurrected, ascended to the Father bodily and will return for His saints before He comes to judge the world and rule the world, and that Christ died for the sins of the world, and that His blood on Calvary has paid the full price for mankind’s redemption and has eternal power to cleanse from all sin and save from Hell (Isaiah 7:l4; Matthew 24:29-3l; Luke 1:3l-35; John l:l,2; Romans 9:l5; 1 Corinthians l5:l-4; 2 Corinthians 5:l4,l5; Philippians 2:6-8; Revelation 3:l0).</p>
 
<p>D. That the Holy Spirit is a Person who convicts the world of sin, of righteousness, and of judgement; and that He is the supernatural Agent in regeneration, baptizing all believers at salvation, indwelling them, and sealing them unto the day of redemption (John l6:l3; Ephesians 5:l8; 1 John 2:20,27).</p>
 
<p>E. That all men are by nature sinful and lost and that for eternal salvation, Holy Spirit regeneration is absolutely essential (John 3:5; Romans 3:24; 5:l; 6:l0; Ephesians 2:8,9; Titus 3:5; 1 John 2:2).</p>
 
<p>F. That men are justified on the single ground of faith in the shed blood of Jesus Christ (Acts l6:3l; Romans 5:l; 2 Corinthians l5:l8-2l; Titus 3:5; 1 John 2:2).</p>
 
<p>G. That Satan is a person and that the lake of Fire is a place of eternal conscious punishment for all unsaved (Isaiah l4:l2-l4; Ezekiel 28:l4; Revelation. 20:7, ll-l5).</p>
 
<p>H. That a New Testament church is a local organized body of baptized believers practicing Scriptural ordinances and being actively engaged in fulfilling the Great Commission (Matthew 28:19,20; 1 Corinthians 5:4; Ephesians 4:ll-l6; 5:23,24; Hebrews l0:25).</p>
 
<p>I. That all the redeemed, that is those who are “born-again”, are kept by God’s power, and are secure in Christ for eternity (John 6:37-40; l0:27-30; Romans 8:l,38,39; 1 Corinthians l:4-8; 1 Peter l:5).</p>
 
<p>J. That it is the privilege of believers to rejoice in the assurance of their salvation through the testimony of God’s Word, which, however, clearly forbids the use of Christian liberty as an occasion to the flesh (Romans l3:l3,l4; Galatians 5:l3; Titus 2:ll-l5).</p>
 
<p>K. That sanctification is God’s will for all believers and that it involves the believer’s separation from the world, his cleansing in life, and complete dedication to Christ in service; but not the eradication of the Adamic nature. That all the saved should live in such a manner as not to bring reproach upon their Saviour and Lord; and, that separation from all religious apostasy, worldly practices and associations is commanded by God, including all forms of immorality and homosexuality (Romans l2:l,2; l4:l3; 2 Corinthians 5:l9,20; 2 Timothy 3:l-5: 1 John 2:l5-l7; 2 John 9-ll).</p>
 
<p>L. That water baptism by immersion following conversion is a symbolic ordinance setting forth the death, burial and resurrection of Christ; and the believer’s union with Him in death and resurrection. That baptism is a Scriptural ordinance of the church requiring immersion of believers only, to be administered by the New Testament local church (Matthew 28:l9,20; Acts 2:38; l0:47; l6:33).</p>
 
<p>M. That the Lord’s Supper is a Scriptural ordinance of the local church to be partaken of by the local church membership (1 Corinthians ll:23-34).</p>
 
<p>N. That there is a physical resurrection of both the saved and the lost; the saved unto the resurrection of life and the lost unto the resurrection of damnation (1 Corinthians l5:5l-57; 2 Corinthians 5:8; 1 Thessalonians 4:l4-l7; Revelation. 20:ll-l5).</p>
 
<p>O. That there will be a pre-millennial, pre-tribulation rapture of the saints (1 Thessalonians 4:l4-l7; Titus 2:l3; Revelation. 3:l0).</p>
 
<p>P. That the modern Charismatic Movement (i.e. tongues, prophecies, healers, signs and wonders, etc.) is not Biblical and we do not accept it as being from God.</p>
 
<p>Q. That the ecumenical drive to unite all religions into one super church is totally unscriptural.</p>
 
<p>R. The above Statement of Faith is the same as our Sending Church – Greater Vancouver Baptist Church.</p>
